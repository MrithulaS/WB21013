<h4>The Neyyar Wildlife Sanctuary in the

       and 8° 29’ to 8° 37’ north latitude, central location 8°33′N 77°12.5′E.
        Although it was declared as a sanctuary in 1958, not much was done
         about wildlife conservation, until 1985, when a separate wildlife
          wing was set up and as a result, conservation 
     efforts have gathered momentum. It is part of
      the Agasthyamala Biosphere Reserve.[1]</h4>
